      Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. 
      The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the packaging and interoperability 
      testing of Hadoop-related projects. This includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, 
      runtime, upgrade, etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather 
      than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to Linux.
