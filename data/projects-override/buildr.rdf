    <shortdesc>Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.</shortdesc>
    <description>We wanted something that's simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.  But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a language that's a joy to use.</description>

        <dc:description>
* Fixed:  Changed references to `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2` to use https where possible.
* Change: Use the `zapwhite` gem to manage file whitespace within repository.
* Fixed:  Replace references to long removed `http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2/` repository with
          `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2`.
* Fixed:  Ensure pom files used in tests use https when referring to maven repositories.
* Added:  Add support for downloading external annotations and attaching them to IntelliJ IDEA module dependencies.
* Added:  Detect external annotations in the local project and add them to the generated IntelliJ IDEA
          module when generating. The default location is `src/main/annotations` but other locations
          can be specified by modifying the `project.iml.annotation_paths` property.
* Fixed:  Explicitly specify the `:sourcepath` parameter for javadoc tool. This enables additional parameters
          such as `-packagenames` and `-subpackages` to be passed to the underling tool.
* Fixed:  Stop generating poms with the parent POM `org.sonatype.oss:oss-parent:8`. The las update was a long time
          ago (i.e. 2012) and it is no longer maintained. It was also deprecated several years ago and is not
          guaranteed to work in modern Maven deployments.

        <created>2019-02-16</created>
        <revision>1.5.7</revision>
        <dc:description>
* Fixed:  The fix that allowed special characters in usernames and passwords was only partially applied
          in the `1.5.6` release. The complete fix that correctly decoded usernames and passwords before
          passing them to HTTP library is now been applied.
* Change: GWT Addon: Added support for `:skip_merge_gwt_dependencies` parameter that makes it possible to
          avoid adding GWT dependencies to the project directly and thus the associated POM. This will be
          required to support GWT3.x and GWT2.x simultaneously as well as making it easier to manage
          dependencies in the POMs.
* Change: Javadoc: If the user does not supply an explicit `:sourcepath` to the doc/javadoc tool then
          default the value to `project.compile.sources`. This will stop javadoc from scanning the classpath
          for `*.java` files which can cause issues with projects that include `sources` classifier artifacts
          on the classpath. This is particularly relevant for GWT based projects that include artifacts with
          source embedded in the artifacts. This change also made it possible to remove an ugly hack in the
          GWT addon that removed the gwt artifacts from the javadoc path.
* Change: Drop deprecated Gem::Specification#has_rdoc= (no replacement) method. Submitted by Olle Jonsson.
* Change: Use https protocol to access Gem metadata. Submitted by Olle Jonsson.
* Change: Change RSpec shared_context usage to avoid warnings. Submitted by Olle Jonsson.
* Change: Migrated source control to Apache GitBox which supports using either GitHub or GitBox as the
          master repository.

      <Version>
        <name>1.5.6</name>
        <created>2018-05-10</created>
        <revision>1.5.6</revision>
        <dc:description>
* Fixed:  Ensure that the username and passwords declared for repositories are correctly url encoded for
          the upload repositories when converted to a URL. (i.e. Ensure `Buildr.repositories.release_to`
          and `Buildr.repositories.snapshot_to` settings can have usernames and passwords with special
          characters).
* Added:  Add support for allowing some dependencies to include transitive dependencies via the
          `pom.include_transitive_dependencies` configuration setting.
* Added:  Add support for adding dependencies to the pom via the `pom.additional_dependencies` configuration
          setting. These dependencies are `compile` scope and are in addition to any derived from the normal
          compile dependencies.
* Fixed:  GWT Addon: Use version `1.0.2` of the `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations:jar` artifact
          when using GWT 2.8.2 to align with version shipped with GWT.
* Fixed:  Dependencies added as `pom.provided_dependencies` or `pom.runtime_dependencies` and not included
          as compile dependencies were incorrectly omitted from pom.
* Fixed:  Dependencies added as `pom.provided_dependencies` and `pom.runtime_dependencies` were being
          incorrectly duplicated within the pom dependencies section. Now provided dependency scope takes
          precedence over runtime scoped dependency.
* Fixed:  Dependencies added to POMs will specify the classifier unless it is the default value.
* Added:  Add the `project.pom.dependency_filter` configuration property that can be set to a proc. The proc
          accepts a dependency and returns a boolean that determines whether the dependency is included in
          the generated pom or not.
* Fixed:  POMs generated by Buildr use the parent pom `org.sonatype.oss:oss-parent:pom:7` but this
          generates a warning in the latest version of Maven. Modern versions of Maven would thus
          ignore transitive dependencies declared in the pom. The parent pom has now been upgraded
          to `org.sonatype.oss:oss-parent:pom:8` which will result in modern Maven correctly picking
          up transitive dependencies.
* Change: JaCoCo Addon: Update JaCoCo version to 0.8.0 which in turns supports Java9.
* Added:  GWT Addon: Added support for `:gwtc_args` parameter to supply arbitrary parameters to
          the GWT compiler.
* Added:  Add support for sha512 digests to be generated for files during the upload. This is typically
          configured by adding `sha512` to the list of digests via a line such as:
          `repositories.release_to[:options] = {:digests => [:md5, :sha1, :sha512]}`
* Fixed:  The default upload tasks would often get a ReadTimeout when uploading using http to a remote
          server that did not have `KeepAlive` socket option enabled and the upload took more than 60
          seconds (the default socket read timeout). Some commercial maven repositories could trigger
          this scenario during upload of even modest size artifacts. Default the read_timeout to 10 minutes
          when during upload to work address this issue.

        <dc:description>
* Fixed:  The concatenation extension released as part of 1.5.4 changed the way zip archives were
          constructed so that entries for some intermediate directories were elided. For most consumers
          of zip files this had no impact but some tools require the entries during scanning. (i.e. Older
          versions of Jruby that loaded ruby scripts from within a jar).
* Added:  IDEA Extension: Added support for passing `:iml_name` parameter to `ipr.add_gwt_configuration`

        <dc:description>
* Added:  Findbugs Addon: Upgrade to version 3.0.1 of findbugs.
* Added:  GPG Addon: Add boolean configuration setting `project.gpg` that can be set to false via
          `project.gpg = false` to avoid signing and uploading packages. This is useful when some
          projects are not intended for publishing.
* Fixed:  JaCoCo Addon: Projects that have jacoco disabled will no longer appear in the JaCoCo reports.
* Change: JaCoCo Addon: Update JaCoCo version to 0.7.9.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-733 - Escape classpath entries in the pathing jar manifest. Submitted by Glenn Croes.
* Fixed:  Ensure that the pom is attached to the jar artifact with empty classifier rather than the last
          artifact of a type defined. Otherwise a project that defines multiple artifacts of the same type
          (i.e. `package(:jar)` and `package(:jar, :classifier => :gwt)`) could have the pom named after
          the package with the classifier rather than the package without a classifer. (i.e. the pom could
          be incorrectly defined as `mypackage-1.0.0-gwt.pom` rather than `mypackage-1.0.0.pom`).
* Added:  GWT Addon: Add support for GWT 2.8.2 release and make it the default version unless otherwise specified.
* Added:  GWT Addon: Added support for `:js_exports` boolean to enable "JsInteropExports".
* Added:  IDEA Extension: Added support for `:open_in_browser` boolean passed to `ipr.add_gwt_configuration`
* Added:  BUILDR-732 - Support bnd version 2.1.0 or more. Submitted By Eric Bruneton.
* Added:  Support to compiling Kotlin
* Fixed:  Remove section on development builds in the Contributing section.
* Added:  New way to concatenate file contents when merging several archives together.
* Added:  New way to transform file contents when merging several archives together.
* Fixed:  Removed .class files from being checked in.
* Added:  Support both Jetty 6 and Jetty 9 as addons. Added integration tests to cover their use.

        <revision>1.5.1</revision>
        <dc:description>
* Change: In the 'buildr/git_auto_version' addon strip out any versions that start with a 'v' character as
          most projects on git repositories prefix version tags with a "v" to avoid collisions with any branchs
          named after the version which are typically without the "v" character.
* Fixed:  GWT Addon: The GWT project publishes invalid jars that can not be included on source path when
          the javadoc tool is executing. Work around this issue in GWT by removing them from the documentation
          class path.
* Change: IDEA: Change the ordering of dependencies in the IDE module descriptor such that test dependencies are
          first to allow test dependencies to override/shadow compile dependencies.
* Fixed:  IDEA: Correctly configure the IDE module if the language level differs from the root project language level.
* Change: Add css2gss task to gwt addon to support conveting from deprecated css syntax to modern gss syntax.
* Change: Add support for gwt 2.8.0 to gwt addon.
* Change: Remove orderedhash gem.
* Change: Update jruby-openssl to 0.9.17
* Change: Move hoe to the development dependencies
* Fixed:  BUILDR-728 Snapshots metadata incorrectly created
* Fixed:  BUILDR-718 Deprecate SVN repository - remove links to SVN
* Change: BUILDR-724 Use scalamain to call scala projects
* Change: BUILDR-719 Change User-Agent when uploading artifacts
* Change: Set the OPEN_IN_BROWSER to false when building idea launch targets via add_glassfish_remote_configuration.
* Change: BUILDR-709 Integrate `buildr/custom_pom` into core and just make it the default pom generated.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-563 protobuf addon including source directories to protoc breaks build

* Added:  Support the :no_invoke parameter being passed to Buildr.project() and
          Buildr.projects() to avoid attempting to call invoke when retrieving the projects.
* Added:  Add `exclude_paths` setting to pmd addon to allow paths to be explicitly excluded.
* Fixed:  Update jDepend addon to ensure target directories are invoked prior to attempting
          to analyze directories.
* Added:  Add jdepend.additional_project_names configuration to jDepend addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one jDepend task.
* Added:  Add findbugs.additional_project_names configuration to Findbugs addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one Findbugs task.
* Added:  Add checkstyle.additional_project_names configuration to Checkstyle addon to
          ease merging in the source paths from multiple projects into one Checkstyle task.
* Added:  Add pmd.additional_project_names configuration to PMD addon to ease merging in
          the source paths from multiple projects into one PMD task.
* Fixed:  In the PMD addon, check that the source directory exists before adding to
          sources directories to include.
* Fixed:  BUILDR-709 - Fix "Exception in jacoco.rb [TypeError : can't convert Array into
          String]". Submitted By Ross Mahony.
* Added:  Define the 'activate_jruby_facet' addon that activates the jruby facet in
          generated IDEA project modules.
* Change: Update the Intellij IDEA plugin to support marking directories as generated.
* Change: Update the Intellij IDEA plugin to correctly identify project paths as resource
          directories.
* Change: Update the default GWT version used in the GWT addon to the latest release 2.7.0.
* Fixed:  Fix GWT addon to explicitly add gwt-dev artifact to gwt compile path now that
          the bug that allowed unintended sharing has been fixed.
* Fixed:  Fix bug in IDEA module generation that resulted in dependencies in IDEA module
          using shared references to compile dependencies.
* Change: Update the checkstyle addon to use checkstyle 6.12.1.

* Change: BUILDR-704 - Updated the Sonar addon to support the latest version of SonarQube
          Runner. Submitted by Ross Mahony.
* Added:  Add support for ipr.add_glassfish_remote_configuration method that generates
          a remote glassfish configuration in IntelliJ IDEA project files.
* Added:  Add support for iml.prefix and ipr.prefix settings that prefix the generated
          IntelliJ IDEA project and module files.
* Change: Update the buildr gemspec so that rspec is no longer a required dependency.
          This enables end-users to use a different version of rspec and buildr in
          the same project. The rspec version MUST be be compatible with the version
          used by Buildr if rspec features are used from within Buildr. Buildr also
          issues a warning if the `check` method is called and rspec has not been loaded.
          The warning includes directions on how to resolve the issue. Submitted by r6p.
* Fixed:  A long standing bug existed such that if tests failed to compile, and the
          option Buildr.options.test is set to :all then the compilation error would
          not result in a failed build. As many people set the Buildr.options.test to
          :all in their continuous delivery/integration tools, this has caused some
          problems. This has been fixed by ensuring all the problems associated with
          the resolving the prerequisites are not caught when Buildr.options.test is
          set to :all.
* Change: Update checkstyle to 6.1.1. Submitted by neher.
* Fixed:  Avoid empty dependency issue in gwt addon if the attempting to gwt compile
          a project that has no src/main/java.
* Fixed:  Support dependencies in the gwt addon that are other local projects rather
          that artifacts, without forcing a compilation of dependency when parsing
