Checklist for adding a new TLP, i.e. a new committee with at least one project:

1. add the committee:
* create the committee RDF file in data/committees/ (copy _template.rdf and edit it)
* link to the RDF file in data/committees.xml
The script scripts/newtlp.py can be used to do the above:

* update site/create.html

2. add projects managed by the committee:
* create the project DOAP somewhere in the project SVN or Git space
* add the DOAP location to data/projects.xml
