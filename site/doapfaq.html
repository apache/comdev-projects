<td width="90%" class="a" valign="top">The form is intended as a simple way to create a DOAP file for a project, it's not intended to be used beyond the initial creation so is limited in its functionality.
You can list as many categories or programming languages as you need for a project, provided you include only those listed on the relevant pages.<br>
To add other categories or programming languages simply duplicate the existing entries with the new details.</td>

<td width="10%" class="biga" valign="top">A</td>
<td width="90%" class="a" valign="top">The simple answer is that there are no hard and fast rules about where the file should be stored. It should be in a location that can be accessed via an http or https request, but beyond that there are no restrictions.<br>Some projects have included the file under the root of their website and provided that URL. They feel this gives them more control over when the file is updated.<br>Other projects have simply committed the file to their repository and provided a URL to the repository as this way they don't have the concern of publishing the file.<br>Either is fine and which is right for your project is something you can decide. Remember you can always change the link!</td>

Please ensure you copy the full section, not a subset. For example, each "Version" must be in its own "release" section,
and each "SVNRepository" and "GitRepository" entry must be in its own "repository" section.
